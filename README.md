Blackbaud-CRM-Code-Table-BizOps--Java-
======================================

## What You Will Build ##

This customization demonstrates how to address code tables through Business Operations Services (BizOps), which is a wrapper API for AppFxWebService targeted to all developers.
BizOps are strongly typed SOAP web services, and you can use them to access Infinity features by adding a reference to the ASMX and beginning to code.
